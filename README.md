# Tabby App Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Tabby mobile application (“App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) and explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. Please read this policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined below.

## Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information we collect directly through the App. It does not apply to data you submit for analysis, as that data is handled externally for the purpose of generating a result and is not stored or retained by us.

## Information We Collect

We collect only the minimal information needed to operate your account:
-  Email address and/or phone number, used for login and account management

We do not collect or retain:
- Prescription images
- Medication data
- Any health-related or diagnostic inputs

## Use of Data

Your email or phone number is used exclusively to support login, authentication, and account recovery. We do not use this information for advertising, profiling, or sharing with third parties.

Prescription or medication-related data you submit is transmitted to external services for processing. This data is used solely for generating a one-time output and is not stored or associated with your user account.

## Third-Party Processing

Some features of the App rely on third-party services to process input data. Once submitted, that data is governed by the privacy policy of the relevant third-party provider. We do not control how these providers use, store, or secure data after it has been transmitted from the App. No personal identifiers (such as your email or phone number) are shared with these providers.

## Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your account credentials and prevent unauthorized access. While data used for analysis is not stored within our systems, it is processed externally under the respective privacy and security practices of our providers.

## Account Deletion

You may delete your account at any time through the App. This will remove your login information (email/phone number) from our systems. As we do not store submitted content, no additional deletion is required.

## Changes to This Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the App. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
